   Combined Target: 55-65% success rate (2x improvement)

5. CONCLUSION
   - Summary of achievements
   - Main limitations
   - Key learnings
   - Final thoughts

================================================================================
PERFORMANCE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Final Results (1,996 test words):
- Success Rate: 29.41% (587 wins)
- Wrong Guesses: 9,182 (avg 4.60 per game)
- Repeated Guesses: 0 (perfect!)
- Final Score: -45,321.82

Score Formula:
  Final Score = (Success Rate × 2000) - (Wrong Guesses × 5) - (Repeated × 2)
              = (0.2941 × 2000) - (9182 × 5) - (0 × 2)
              = 588.2 - 45,910 - 0
              = -45,321.82

REPORT HIGHLIGHTS
================================================================================

✅ Zero repeated guesses achieved (perfect state tracking)
✅ Effective HMM linguistic pattern learning
✅ Smart exploration strategy (HMM-guided epsilon-greedy)
✅ Comprehensive analysis of challenges and solutions
✅ Detailed future improvement roadmap
✅ 10+ proposed enhancements with expected impact

Key Insight: HMM alone achieved ~25% success, showing linguistic patterns
matter more than game-specific strategy for Hangman.

Main Limitation: Tabular Q-learning insufficient for high-dimensional state
space. Deep Q-Networks would provide better generalization.
